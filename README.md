## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive documentation for a Packet Sniffer application developed in C. The application leverages the `libpcap` library to capture and analyze network packets in real-time. It is designed to filter and display various types of packets, including TCP, UDP, ICMP (v4 and v6), ARP, NDP, IGMP, and MLD, based on user-defined criteria. This documentation covers the theoretical background, code structure and testing methodology of the application.

## Theoretical Background

The Packet Sniffer application operates on the data link layer, utilizing the `libpcap` library to capture packets transmitted over the network. It can process and filter packets based on protocol type, source and destination ports, and other criteria. Understanding the following concepts is essential:

- **Packet Sniffing**: Monitoring and capturing data packets passing through a network.
- **libpcap**: A portable C/C++ library for network traffic capture. [libcap]
- **Network Protocols**: Rules and formats for communication between network devices. This application focuses on TCP, UDP, ICMP [RFC792] and [RFC4443], ARP [RFC826], NDP [RFC4861], IGMP [RFC3376], and MLD [RFC3810].

## Code Structure and Features

### Main Components

- `struct Options`: Holds user-defined options for packet filtering.
- `parse_arguments`: Parses command-line arguments and populates the `Options` structure.
- `list_interfaces`: Lists all active network interfaces.
- `open_interface`: Opens a network interface for packet capturing.
- `set_filter`: Compiles and sets a filter based on user options.
- `process_packet`: Callback function to process and print details of each captured packet.
- `capture_packets`: Starts the packet capture loop.
- `signal_handler`: Handles SIGINT signal for graceful shutdown.

### Interesting Code Sections

- **Argument Parsing**: The application uses a custom argument parsing mechanism to handle various command-line options, demonstrating a practical application of string comparison and conditional logic in C.
- **Packet Processing**: The `process_packet` function showcases how to dissect network packets and extract useful information, such as MAC addresses, IP addresses, and protocol-specific data.

## Testing

### Testing Environment

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- **Network Setup**: Home Wi-Fi network.
- **Comparison Tool**: Wireshark 3.2.3 for validation.

### Testing Methodology

Tests were conducted to validate the functionality of the Packet Sniffer and compare its performance and accuracy with Wireshark. The following aspects were tested:

- **Interface Listing**: Ensured that all active interfaces are listed correctly.
- **Packet Capturing**: Verified that packets are captured accurately based on the specified filters.
- **Protocol Filtering**: Tested filtering for each supported protocol to ensure correct functionality.

### Test Cases

For testing used python script which sends some garbage packets and needed one, as reference used Wireshark.
Here is some examples of test cases:

#### ARP test case

### Comparison with Wireshark

- **Accuracy**: Both tools captured and displayed packets accurately. However, Wireshark provides more detailed analysis and a graphical interface.
- **Performance**: The Packet Sniffer demonstrated comparable performance to Wireshark for basic packet capturing and filtering tasks.

## Conclusion

The Packet Sniffer application serves as a lightweight, command-line alternative to graphical network analysis tools like Wireshark. It demonstrates effective use of the `libpcap` library for packet capturing and filtering, providing a solid foundation for further development and customization.
